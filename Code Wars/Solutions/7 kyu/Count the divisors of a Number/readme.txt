This a brute force solution, I have found a better way to do it
through prime factorization and exponents. I don't have time to
develop it tonight so I may return to this problem. I would have
been forced to use it if the test cases went too high but I was
lucky. I suppose this is only a 7kyu so it makes sense.

Count the number of divisors of a positive integer n.

Random tests go up to n = 500000.

Examples (input --> output)
4 --> 3 (1, 2, 4)
5 --> 2 (1, 5)
12 --> 6 (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12)
30 --> 8 (1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 30)
Note you should only return a number, the count of divisors. The numbers between parentheses are shown only for you to see which numbers are counted in each case.

Not much to say here, I'm pretty tired. Anayways just a simple set to
test for repeated values as sets can only take one of a type of letter
then set the set size to test against origional string length.

An isogram is a word that has no repeating letters, consecutive or non-consecutive. Implement a function that determines whether a string that contains only letters is an isogram. Assume the empty string is an isogram. Ignore letter case.

Example: (Input --> Output)

"Dermatoglyphics" --> true
"aba" --> false
"moOse" --> false (ignore letter case)

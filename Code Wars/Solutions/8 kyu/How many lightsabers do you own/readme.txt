Very simple 8 kyu, I'm going on a
hike tomorrow so I need to get to sleep
but I used this to employ a ternary
operator for the first time in
production. They're pretty cool.

Inspired by the development team at Vooza, write the function that

accepts the name of a programmer, and
returns the number of lightsabers owned by that person.
The only person who owns lightsabers is Zach, by the way. He owns 18, which is an awesome number of lightsabers. Anyone else owns 0.

Note: your function should have a default parameter.

For example(Input --> Output):

"anyone else" --> 0
"Zach" --> 18

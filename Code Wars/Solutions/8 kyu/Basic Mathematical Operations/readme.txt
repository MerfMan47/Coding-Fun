This one was very simple, I have a feeling I didn't do it in the
most efficient way but something with an easy solution like this
does not need to be efficient.

Your task is to create a function that does four basic mathematical operations.

The function should take three arguments - operation(string/char), value1(number), value2(number).
The function should return result of numbers after applying the chosen operation.

Examples(Operator, value1, value2) --> output
('+', 4, 7) --> 11
('-', 15, 18) --> -3
('*', 5, 5) --> 25
('/', 49, 7) --> 7

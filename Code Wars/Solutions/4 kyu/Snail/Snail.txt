=============================Notes=============================
This is my first successful 4 kyu completion, it looks so simple
after it's finished. The program simply adds the values from the
top of the array and they removes the entire top row. The same
thing is done to the right side, bottom, then left side, after
which the process begins again until the array is empty. I could
have made it cleaner by making each 'side' a function then
calling the function with a smaller code footprint but, eh.

I am also happy with this as this is my first bit of code after
a small break I took for two week duriung finals.

Snail Sort
Given an n x n array, return the array elements arranged from outermost elements to the middle element, traveling clockwise.

array = [[1,2,3],
         [4,5,6],
         [7,8,9]]
snail(array) #=> [1,2,3,6,9,8,7,4,5]
For better understanding, please follow the numbers of the next array consecutively:

array = [[1,2,3],
         [8,9,4],
         [7,6,5]]
snail(array) #=> [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
This image will illustrate things more clearly:
(404)

NOTE: The idea is not sort the elements from the lowest value to the highest; the idea is to traverse the 2-d array in a clockwise snailshell pattern.

NOTE 2: The 0x0 (empty matrix) is represented as en empty array inside an array [[]].

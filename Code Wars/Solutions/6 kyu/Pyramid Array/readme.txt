This one took longer then it sould have. I blame it on
my recovering from my two week illness. I hope to 
return to daily practice. Anyways this was a nested
loop solution, and thus there is an algorithm that
would be more efficient but I suppose this solution
works.
=========================Notes=========================
Write a function that when given a number >= 0, returns an Array of ascending length subarrays.

pyramid(0) => [ ]
pyramid(1) => [ [1] ]
pyramid(2) => [ [1], [1, 1] ]
pyramid(3) => [ [1], [1, 1], [1, 1, 1] ]
Note: the subarrays should be filled with 1s

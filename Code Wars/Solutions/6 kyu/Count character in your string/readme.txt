I did this one in a group so many of
the tests are still in the code along
with the console logs. It was the first
kata with objects I understood so this
was a nice one to have explained.

The main idea is to count all the occurring characters in a string. If you have a string like aba, then the result should be {'a': 2, 'b': 1}.

What if the string is empty? Then the result should be empty object literal, {}.
